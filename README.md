## Features

Geis' primary goals are **reliability**, **consistency** and **observability**.

It is fundamentally different from other background job processing tools because
_it retains job data for historic metrics and inspection_. You can leave your
application running indefinitely without worrying about jobs being lost or
orphaned due to crashes.

#### Advantages Over Other Tools

- **Fewer Dependencies** — If you are running a web app there is a _very good_
  chance that you're running on top of a [RDBMS][rdbms]. Running your job queue
  within PostgreSQL minimizes system dependencies and simplifies data backups.

- **Transactional Control** — Enqueue a job along with other database changes,
  ensuring that everything is committed or rolled back atomically.

- **Database Backups** — Jobs are stored inside of your primary database, which
  means they are backed up together with the data that they relate to.
